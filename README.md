# LSTMSentimentAnalysis

Course project for Structured Models for NLP, 2017

Built a sentence sentiment classifier, compared different neural network models (RNN, CNN, FFNN). The accuracy was improved from 75.5% (Deep Averaging Network) to 80.5% (LSTM).

The dataset consists of sentences from Rotten Tomatoes classified as either positive or negative sentiment, as introduced in Pang and Lee (2005). This dataset was also evaluated on in Kim (2014) (as the MR dataset) and in Iyyer et al. (2015) (as the RT dataset).
